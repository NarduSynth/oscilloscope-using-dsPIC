# oscilloscope-using-dsPIC
PIC Based Oscilloscope at 1MSPS. Sends data to PC at 57000 baud hosting a C# GUI program that shows the analog waveform

This repo contains an MPLABX project using the free version of the XC16 compiler. The associated C# program graphs the data sent up from the MCU via a TTL-to-USB converter. Both the PC and embedded firmware can be built from source using free tools.
